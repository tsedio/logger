# What is Ts.ED?

Ts.ED is a framework for building server-side and scalable applications for Node.js environment. It's built with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses classes (OOP), decorators and Functional programming
to develop your application.

It uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) HTTP server frameworks by default, but it's also possible to use [Koa.js](https://koajs.com) or [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) as well.

Ts.ED provides a level of abstraction above these common Node.js frameworks (Express/Koa) with the [Platform API](https://tsed.dev/docs/platform-api)
but also exposes their APIs directly for the developer. It gives developers the freedom to use the myriad of third-party
node modules which are available for the underlying platform.

## Philosophy

Node.js opened the possibility of making server applications with Javascript, allowing to pool front-end and back-end skills.

With this we have seen the birth of extraordinary projects like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io).
Each of these projects bring their vision of a web application, but we have the same wish, to make the developer's life easier by providing
all the right tools to developers so that they are quickly productive.

Ts.ED tends towards the same objective which is to achieve better productivity while remaining easy to understand.
To achieve this, Ts.ED provides out-of-the-box an application architecture, highly testable, scalable and maintainable.
